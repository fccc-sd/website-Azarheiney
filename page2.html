    <h3>Minecraft</h3>
        <p>
            Minecraft is a sandbox game with Survival, Hardcore and Creative where you can do almost anything.
            When creating the world the four different difficulties are peaceful, easy, normal, and hard,
            there is also a choice to mess with more world settings such as adding a bonus chest or making
            the world a superflat world. In Survival the player can die multiple times, turn on cheats and
            change gamemode, the player has to eat to keep health and hunger up, but there are potions
            that help with healing. In Hardcore the player only gets one life, once the player dies they can
            either spectate or delete the world. Hardcore is the hardest difficulty in the game, the mobs are
            stronger, the player takes more damage from other things, and hunger depletes faster. In Creative
            mode the player doesn't have to worry about any of these things, they also have acess to all
            the blocks in the game, but some can only be givni to the player through commands.
        <br><br> 
            There are a lot of different mobs in Minecraft, a couple are pigs, skeletons, and villagers.
            There are peaceful mobs that the player can tame such as wolves,cats, and horses. Other mobs
            the player can use to get food, pigs, cows, sheep, chickens. Some ofthe harmful mobs are
            skeletons, spiders, creepers, zombies, pilligers, evokers, piglin brute, piglins. There are
            some mobs that are considered boss mobs, those mobs are the Ender Dragon, the Whither, and the
            Worden, all of which have a ton of health and take a few minutes to deafeat the first time. After
            deafeating the boss mobs the first time the exerence points that is gained becomes less and less.
        <br><br> 
            There are also a ton of different free addons that can be downloaded. They can do different things
            such as add new items, different mechanics and shader packs, that overall chage how the game is
            played. A few of the different mods that can be installed are called Atlas, Origins, and HUD+,
            they all slightly change how the game can be played. The mod Atlas adds a map that can add markers,
            and there is even an addon for that mod that adds color to the map. Origins add different mob
            origins that can be played as, each origin has some good things and bad things, some origins
            have more good than bad or more bad than good. My favorite origin is called Enderian, where the
            player can teleport without usuing enderpearls or taking fall damage from them, however the player
            can't go into water very long before taking damage. HUD+ adds some new things that can be seen
            when not in the inventory, such as being able to see how much durability is left on armor or tools,
            how many inventory slots are open, how many arrows the player has and more.

        <h3>The Sims 4</h3>
        <p>
            In the Sims 4 the player gets to create and design a person and house as well as buy packs that
            add items to the game. When in the Create-A-Sim menu, or the CAS menu, the player gets
            to pick how their Sim will look, and have up to 8 Sims in one household. There are a lot of
            different combinations that people come up with for their Sim with and without Custom Content,
            or CC, once the player is finished designing their Sim they get to pick a name, favorite
            things and how the Sim will act. After finishing in the CAS menu the player gets to pick where 
            their Sim lives, and to start out they get 20,000 Simoleons to pick a lot. Once the player buys 
            the lot that they picked, they can have their Sim get a job, make some friends, or just mess around.
            There is also a buy/build mode where the player can buy and build things that can help with whatever
            they are doing with their Sims. The player can buy a lot of different things such as kitchen
            appliances, bedroom items, things for living rooms, and decerations. In build mode the player
            can build walls, delete walls, and terrain the land.

        <h3>Five Nights at Freddys</h3>
        <p>
            The Five Nights at Freddys, FNaF, game and book series has been around since 2014, and has grown to
            have 10 games, 3 book series and soon a movie. The first FNaF game came out in August of 2014,
            made by Scott Cawthon and FNaF1 is how everything in the FNaF series came to be.
        <br><br>
            The first game also has the original animatronics in the Fazbear franchise, but the games have 
            secrets in them. If the player looks to the camera 2b there is a chance that the poster will 
            change from Freddy to a yellow bear that the fansbase calls Golden Freddy, as well as looking 
            at camera 1c, or Pirates Cove, the sign might say "IT'S ME" instead of 'Out of Order'. The second
            game, FNaF2, has 10 animatronics with a new features considering the office doesn't have doors
            to keep the animatronics out, the nightguard gets a flashlight that helps keep the animatronics
            away from the front part of the office. There are vents on each side that some animatronics
            will go through, if the animatronic called Balloon Boy makes it into the office he makes it
            so that the flashlight stops working for a little bit. On one of the cameras there is a music
            box that needs to be wound up, if the player lets it get low enough the animatronic in the box
            will make its way to the office, there is no way to stop it when the music box runs out.
        <br><br>    
            There are a bunch of different theories on everything in the FNaF series, a youtuber that made
            theories on FNaF is MatPat, he has made over 80 videos on FNaF theories alone. He also makes 
            theory videos on other games, books, cooking, and fashion. Other youtubers such as Astrilspiff
            and Backseat Gaming have made videos and live streams on the game Five Nights at Freddys:
            Secrity breach, these youtubers have found bugs, glitches, and other ways to bend the game to do
            what they want it to do. Astrilspiffs most popular FNaF video is him doing 600%, it took him a long
            time to complete. Beakseat Gaming and Astrilspiff have both done a lot with the game, they have
            both beat the game backwards, without using Freddy, and without picking up anything.

        <h3>A Song of Fire and Ice</h3>
        <p>
            A Song of Fire and Ice is a rythem game that starts out pretty easy but quickly gets more difficult
            , a few features that the game has are setting the offset of the devices sound by tapping
            to the beat that is played. The first few levels are getting the player used to how the game
            works, and teaching the first few simple things that they can do. There are different devices
            to play it on such as phones, or coumputers. To pick a level when playing on a laptop the
            player has to get the balls overto the level they want to play, when playing on a phone the
            player just swipes to the world and level that they want to play. There are also levels that other
            players have made, a lot of them are difficult if the player is still new to the game.
